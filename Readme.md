# SparkTimer

Calculates estimated print time for SparkMaker prints

## Details
This only runs on Windows. You may need to download a .Net installer, I'm not sure. I've put in the bare minimum effort so far, but if people think it's useful, I can add new features, and better details on running it.

## How to Run 
Unzip the file, and run `SparkTimer.exe`. Drag your print.wow file to the left hand panel. After a moment, details will appear on the right.

## Thanks
Thanks to [bastirichter](https://github.com/bastirichter) for the `.wow` [spec breakdown](https://github.com/bastirichter/Sparkmaker/).

## TODO
- [x] Get out an initial bare-minimum build
- [x] Do processing in a non-UI thread, and add progress indicator to UI
- [x] Add a Layer Viewer
